*Requests* Library
******************


Requests is an `ISC Licensed`_ HTTP library, written in Python, for
human beings. [#f1]_

Requests takes all of the work out of Python HTTP/1.1 â€” making your integration
with web services seamless. There's no need to manually add query strings to
your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection
pooling are 100%  automatic, powered by `urllib3
<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_, which is embedded within Requests.
